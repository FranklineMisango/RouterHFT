## Core Features

1. High-Precision Timing System
    - Nanosecond-level timestamp management
    - PTP (Precision Time Protocol) synchronization
    - Hardware-level timing optimization

2. Regulatory Compliance Framework
    - CME Rule 575 (Prohibited Trading Practices)
    - FINRA Rule 6140 (Anti-Latency Arbitrage)
    - SEC Regulation ATS (Fair Access)
    - Automated compliance monitoring and reporting

3. Network Latency Mapping
    - PTP-synchronized traceroute analysis
    - Geographic visualization (Folium/Plotly)
    - Interactive dashboards for route optimization

4. FPGA Packet Prioritization
    - Verilog-based hardware acceleration
    - Exchange-specific packet classification
    - PCIe DMA bypass for ultra-low latency

5. BGP Route Simulation
    - Multi-path routing analysis
    - Convergence optimization
    - Alternative route discovery

## Testing & Quality Assurance

- Performance benchmarks included
- Integration and compliance validation

## Deployment

- Docker containerization and orchestration
- Monitoring and visualization stack
- Production-ready configuration

## Quick Start Guide

1. Run the Demo:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/misango/codechest/RouterHFT
    python demo.py
    ```
2. Run Tests:
    ```bash
    python -m pytest tests/ -v
    ```
3. Start the Main System:
    ```bash
    python -m src.main
    ```
4. Deploy with Docker:
    ```bash
    cd docker
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

## Live Demo Results
